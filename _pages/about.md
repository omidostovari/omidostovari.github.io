## Hi, I'm Omid! (Persian: اُمید) ☀️

My name, *Omid* (also transliterated as Omeed, Umeed, or Ümit in Turkish), means *hope* in Persian, Turkish, and Kurdish—something I strive to bring into my work every day. As a researcher and AI enthusiast, I'm passionate about blending artificial intelligence with neuroscience. Currently, I'm diving deep into computational neuroscience at the University of Tehran, where I work on decoding neural activity and enhancing neuron extraction using deep learning. My journey started in computer engineering, and over the years, I’ve explored everything from deep learning to neuroimaging and bioinformatics.
